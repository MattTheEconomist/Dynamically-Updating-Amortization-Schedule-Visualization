# Dynamically Updating Amortization Schedule Visualization

This tool visualizes the amount going towards principal and interest for each mortgage payment. Using python's Plotly and Dash libraries, users can update their rate and loan amount using sliders. Plotly then dynamically updates the amortization visualization based on these inputs. Hovering the mouse over any particular payment on the graph displays the exact amount going towards pincipal and interest.
